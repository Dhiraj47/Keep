# Keep

You wil need XAMPP or(WAMPP) to run this app.
Just copy the app folder in any folder(if you have installed XAMPP then copy the whole file into "C:/xampp/htdocs and then in any folder")
Then make a database of name gallery(or not then change the database name in db_connection.php file) using xampp.
After that import the table (i.e. gallery.sql) into that database, from ./flickr/files/gallery.sql.
Thats it. after that just run your program from your localhost.
